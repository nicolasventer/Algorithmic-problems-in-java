[Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/) is a site where there are algorithmic problems.  
They can be solved in competition or whenever.

I solve all theses problems in Java, but the language is not imposed.

I use [Competitive-dl](https://github.com/shravan97/competitive-dl) to download the subject into pdf.

I use [TTR PDF To JPG3](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ttrpdftojpg/) to convert each pdf.

I have implemented [readmeMaker.jar](readmeMaker.jar) to automatically create readme files. [(source code)](ReadmeMaker.java)

You can directly launch it or you can use the command :
```bash
java -jar readmeMaker.jar
```
It will show the list of the readme files created.

If you want to overwrite them, use the command :
```bash
java -jar readmeMaker.jar -f
```
